  - I hope you don't think it's a bad thing, right?
  - Although you cold-bloodedly killed those statues knowing they are people...
  - for me it's better to be dead than to be doomed to be a marble statue for eternity.
  - Freeing them from this suffering doesn't make you a bad person.
  - I like to beleive they are in a far better place now.
