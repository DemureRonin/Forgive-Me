  _sentences:
  - This world has frozen in time as you can see.
  - These marble statues once were humans in constant suffering.
  - And with each dream they had they became harder and heavier...
  - only to eventually turn into a cold marble.
  - We call them "Martyrs".
  - The big marble statues have been here for a long time.
  - They can't move, so they are harmless.
  - The smaller ones can attack if troubled though.
  - Their agression for the pain that was caused to them...
  - is the only thing they have left.
